# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Voice Journal

## 1. Overview
The Voice Journal is a voice-first journaling application that allows users to externalize thoughts by speaking naturally, without typing, structure, or pressure. It is designed to feel like thinking out loud in a private space, where ideas can be paused, continued, and revisited over time. The system listens by default and only responds when explicitly invited.

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional journaling requires typing, structure, and intentional effort, which creates friction and prevents many people from journaling consistently. Existing voice tools treat speech as an input method for commands rather than a medium for reflection.

People need a journal that:
- Matches how they think.
- Does not judge or interrupt.
- Does not require discipline or structure.
- Preserves thoughts reliably.

## 3. Product Goals

Primary Goals:
- Make journaling effortless through voice.
- Support pauses, interruptions, and continuation.
- Preserve raw, unedited thought.
- Build trust through silence and reliability.

Non-Goals:
- Productivity tracking.
- Mental health diagnosis.
- Coaching by default.
- Social sharing.
- Streaks or gamification.

## 4. User Experience Principles
- Journaling starts immediately.
- No prompts required.
- No right way to journal.
- Silence is acceptable.
- The journal does not judge.

## 5. Core Concepts

Journal Entry:
A voice-captured stream of thought that can be paused, continued, and closed.

Pause:
Temporary break; entry remains current.

Close Entry:
Ends the entry; preserves it in the journal.

## 6. AI Behavior
- Silent by default.
- Responds only to explicit requests.
- Never interrupts.
- Acts as a reflection tool, not a guide.

## 7. Privacy and Trust
- Audio not stored.
- Entries are private.
- Deletion is permanent.
- No background AI training.

## 8. Success Criteria
The product is successful when users:
- Journal naturally within minutes.
- Return to entries over time.
- Pause without fear of loss.
- Trust the system completely.

## 9. Future Opportunities (Not MVP)
- Optional reflection tools.
- Entry summaries (opt-in).
- Long-term pattern discovery.
- Export-based workflows.

## 10. Final Statement
This product exists to give people a place to put their thoughts without having to shape them.
